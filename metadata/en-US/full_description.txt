The new home app (the launcher) of your Android device to replace ugly home apps that are too colourful, bright, distracting, confusing, inefficient, and full of non-sensical icons.

Provides clarity by minimal, efficient, and elegant design based on text. It allows to configure quick access to apps, shortcuts, or contacts in different ways (including gestures), and it removes confusing stuff from the home screen.

Supports shortcuts, integrates the contact list (if you want to), and its search function includes a configurable web search.

For users who value clarity and straight design.

Tries to have enough configurability without making testing corner cases tedious, to ensure functionality and robustness.

New app developed from scratch.

Takes inspiration from Unlauncher (a fork of Slimlauncher), and Nolauncher, and also feedback of users.

Features:

  - configurable quick access links and gestures on home screen
  - shortcut support (long click on app by default)
  - hide/show apps (but keep searchable)
  - apps can be renamed (in the launcher)
  - integrated contact list into search
  - integrated, configurable web search
  - multiple clock options
  - date format options
  - configurable colour scheme
  - free open source software
  - no icon set support (not needed: no icons at all)
  - no widget support
