The home app (the launcher) to replace ugly home apps that are too colourful, distracting, inefficient, and full of non-sensical icons.

Clarity by efficient and elegant design based on text. With configurable quick access to apps, shortcuts, or contacts via a list or by gestures.

Supports app shortcuts, both static and dynamic.

Search function optionally integrates the contact list, and includes a configurable web search.

Tries to have enough configurability without making testing corner cases tedious, to ensure functionality and robustness.

Weather info (uses network and location services, if necessary).
