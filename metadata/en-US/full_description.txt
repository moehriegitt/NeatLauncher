The new home app (the launcher) of your Android device to replace ugly home apps that are too colourful, bright, distracting, confusing, inefficient, and full of non-sensical icons.

Provides clarity by minimal, efficient, and elegant design based on text. It allows to configure quick access to apps, shortcuts, or contacts in different ways (including gestures), and it removes confusing stuff from the home screen.

Supports shortcuts, integrates the contact list (if you want to), and its search function includes a configurable web search.

For users who value clarity and straight design.

Tries to have enough configurability without making testing corner cases tedious, to ensure functionality and robustness.

New app developed from scratch.

Takes inspiration from Unlauncher (a fork of Slimlauncher), and Nolauncher, and also feedback of users.

  - uniform and elegant text-based design
