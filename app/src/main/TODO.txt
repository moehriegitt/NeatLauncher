  * FAQ for issues reported by users
      * in-app or offline?  better in-app
      * 'Nothing' app to disable swipe gestures
      * open keyboard immediately in drawer (use click instead of swipe up)
      * configure default search engine

  * weather: list the weather code Unicode 'icons'
      * replace multiple when() in code by an array for better modularity
      * generate the helping table from this new array
