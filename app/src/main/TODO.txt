# TODOs

## For next feature release

  * update docs

  * update screenshots

## Possibly for later releases

  * have a generic rain display (instead of only on analog clock)

  * have internal actions as item so they can be pinned and reconfigured
    (but converting to activities or fragments seems like overkill)
      * all dialogs (incl., weather symbols, about, etc.)
      * drawer open; drawer open w/ keyboard
      * actions in opt menus: info, app language

  * translate to Dutch
  * translate to Czech
  * translate to Tircunan (Latin and Ukaliq scripts)
  * translate to Inuktitut (Latin, Syllabics, and Ukaliq scripts)
