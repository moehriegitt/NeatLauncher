# TODOs

## For any release

  * update docs

  * update screenshots

## Bugs to be fixed

  * Sometimes the headline of weather is not displayed.  It was scrolled out to the
    left.  This happens when a long name makes the widget wide and it can then be scrolled
    manually (and accidentally).  Even when a shorter headline is used afterwards, the
    widget does not shrink back, at least until the app is restarted.

  * Weather 'Current Location' does not work too well.  When switched on, no location is queried,
    so nothing is shown.  I am not sure when it actually queries the current location, really.
    Sometimes, after a while, weather info does show up.  I've also seen it switch to the data
    of the last selected location instead.  The request for location is actually sent in the App,
    so not sure how to fix this.
    [not yet explicable]

## For next feature release

  * auto-save option

  * polish translation

## Possibly for later releases

  * french translation (current version lacks proof-reading)

  * give feedback why weather is not displayed; black box is bad

  * list upcoming events from calendar

  * have a generic rain display (instead of only on analog clock)

  * have internal actions as item so they can be pinned and reconfigured
    (but converting to activities or fragments seems like overkill)
      * all dialogs (incl., weather symbols, about, etc.)
      * drawer open; drawer open w/ keyboard
      * actions in opt menus: info, app language

  * translate to Dutch
  * translate to Czech
  * translate to Tircunan (Latin and Ukaliq scripts)
  * translate to Inuktitut (Latin, Syllabics, and Ukaliq scripts)

## Postponed indefinitely

  * generic Android widget support
