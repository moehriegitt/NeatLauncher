# TODOs

## For next feature release

  * FAQ for issues reported by users
      * in-app or offline?  better in-app
      * 'Nothing' app to disable swipe gestures
      * open keyboard immediately in drawer (use click instead of swipe up)
      * configure default search engine

  * make location coordinates editable

  * update docs

  * update screenshots

## Possibly for later releases

  * have a generic rain display (instead of only on analog clock)

  * have internal actions as item so they can be pinned and reconfigured
    (but converting to activities seems like overkill)
      * all dialogs (incl., weather symbols, about, etc.)
      * drawer open; drawer open w/ keyboard
      * actions in opt menus: info, app language
