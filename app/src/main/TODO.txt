# TODOs

## For any release

  * update docs

  * update screenshots

  * check changelogs are added to VC

  * check metadata for new languages is added to VC

## Bugs to be fixed

## Inconveniences to be investigated

  * Weather 'Current Location' does not work too well.  When switched on, no location is queried,
    so nothing is shown.  I am not sure when it actually queries the current location, really.
    Sometimes, after a while, weather info does show up.  I've also seen it switch to the data
    of the last selected location instead.  The request for location is actually sent in the App,
    so not sure how to fix this.
    [not yet explicable]

## For next feature release

  * auto-save option

## Possibly for later releases

  * french translation (current draft lacks proof-reading)

  * list upcoming events from calendar

  * have a generic rain display (instead of only on analog clock)

  * have internal actions as item so they can be pinned and reconfigured
    (but converting to activities or fragments seems like overkill)
      * all dialogs (incl., weather symbols, about, etc.)
      * drawer open; drawer open w/ keyboard
      * actions in opt menus: info, app language

  * translate to Dutch
  * translate to Czech
  * translate to Tircunan (Latin and Ukaliq scripts)
  * translate to Inuktitut (Latin, Syllabics, and Ukaliq scripts)

## Postponed indefinitely

  * generic Android widget support
