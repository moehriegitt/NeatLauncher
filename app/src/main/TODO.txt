# TODOs

## For any release

  * update docs

  * update screenshots

## Bugs to be fixed

  * sometimes the headline of weather is not displayed.  Dunno when, maybe if all days are old?
    One user had this problem, probably after a while (>24h?) of no network contact.
    Longer titles were displayed in part, missing some text on the left(!), indicating a
    shifted table.  Why was it so wide then?  How to reproduce and test?  The table was
    not invisible, but also nothing was shown.  Or was there info in the future?
    [not yet reproduced]

## For next feature release

  * current weather info (in title line, probably)

  * auto-save option

  * french and polish translations

## Possibly for later releases

  * give feedback why weather is not displayed; black box is bad

  * list upcoming events from calendar

  * have a generic rain display (instead of only on analog clock)

  * have internal actions as item so they can be pinned and reconfigured
    (but converting to activities or fragments seems like overkill)
      * all dialogs (incl., weather symbols, about, etc.)
      * drawer open; drawer open w/ keyboard
      * actions in opt menus: info, app language

  * translate to Dutch
  * translate to Czech
  * translate to Tircunan (Latin and Ukaliq scripts)
  * translate to Inuktitut (Latin, Syllabics, and Ukaliq scripts)

## Postponed indefinitely

  * generic Android widget support
